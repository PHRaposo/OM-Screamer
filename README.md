#### OM-Screamer is an adaptation of the propagation part of SCREAMER to the paradigm of visual programming language of Openmusic.

SCREAMER is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for nondeterministic
programming. Screamer consists of two levels. The basic nondeterministic level
adds support for backtracking and undoable side effects. On top of this
nondeterministic substrate, Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint
programming language in which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of
numeric and symbolic constraints. Together, these two levels augment Common
Lisp with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and constraint
logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R). Furthermore, Screamer is
 fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer programs can coexist and
 interoperate with other extensions to as CLIM and Iterate.
